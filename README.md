I have completed the code challenge.

I used NodeJS and Typescript. I tried to implement a solution using the constructor injections. 
As I mentioned during the interview I never used them, so I hope that it is fine or at least that I was the on right track.

I have also created unit tests using Mocha with ts-mockito (never used before so hope it's ok).

I have used a quick TS setup for the project, I think it is enough to run the app.

Run the app: 
1) npm install
2) npm start - to run the app
3) npm test to run all tests or npm run coverage - to run all test and display the test coverage results
